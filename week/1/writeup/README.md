### Part 2 (75 pts)

Since the company is a large automotive manufacturer, the ECU’s issue can result in injuries and death to many people. My first intent would be contacting my boss and bring up the issue. If my boss agrees to fix the issue as soon as possible, then this will be the end of it. If my boss doesn’t take the issue seriously, I will contact the next higher representative in the company. I will keep contacting and addressing the issue to the full extent of my power. If the company is unwilling to address the ECU’s issue, I would have to become a whistleblower. Becoming a whistleblower is my last option because of the treatment and consequences of revealing a wrongdoing. I believe if a person does nothing and they knew the harm it could cause, they are responsible for the damage. Since I knew about the ECU’s issue, I would gather all the possible evidence. If I believe if I have enough evidence to support my case, I would go to a consumer watchdog and then to the media. Furthermore, I would get a lawyer who represents whistleblowers. I would try to get a case and prepare for a long battle.
